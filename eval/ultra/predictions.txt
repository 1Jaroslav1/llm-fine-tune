What are irritable heart cells, and how do they affect the heart? <END_Q><START_A>Irritable heart cells are a type of cardiac cell that can cause damage to the heart muscle. Irritability refers to the ability of a cell to respond to changes in its environment by altering its behavior or function. In the case of irritable heart cells, this means that they are more prone to producing signals that can disrupt normal heart function. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). There are several different types of irritable heart cells, each with their own unique characteristics and effects on the heart. Understanding these different types is important for diagnosing and treating conditions related to irritable heart cells. <END_A>

Can you get genital herpes from a public restroom toilet seat if you have an open wound or sore on your buttocks? <END_Q><START_A>No, it is not possible to get genital herpes from a public restroom toilet seat. The virus that causes genital herpes (herpes simplex virus) is primarily spread through skin-to-skin contact with an infected person. This means that if someone has an open wound or sore on their buttocks, they may be more likely to contract the virus from another person who has the infection. However, this transmission would require direct contact between the infected area and the uninfected person's mouth or genitals. Therefore, using a public restroom toilet seat alone does not pose a significant risk for contracting genital herpes. It is important to practice good hygiene and avoid sharing personal items such as towels or razors to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus. If you suspect you may have genital herpes, consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. <END_A>

Why do HPV-vaccinated women still need regular cervical screening? <END_Q><START_A>HPV vaccination is a preventive measure against human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause cervical cancer. The vaccine protects against two types of HPV that are responsible for 90% of cervical cancers, as well as other types that can lead to genital warts and other sexually transmitted infections. However, even with the vaccine, it is still important for women who have been vaccinated to undergo regular cervical screening. This is because the vaccine does not provide complete protection against all types of HPV or against precancerous changes in the cervix. Therefore, regular Pap smears and HPV tests can help detect any abnormal cells or precancerous changes early on, when they can be treated before they progress to cancer. It is recommended that women who have been vaccinated continue to receive routine cervical screening until age 25, and then every three years thereafter. By following these guidelines, women can reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer and improve their overall health outcomes. <END

What happens during angina attacks? When the heart muscle does not get enough blood, it cannot function properly. This can cause pain or discomfort in the chest, as well as other symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, and nausea. Angina is a common symptom of coronary artery disease (CAD), which occurs when plaque builds up inside the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Plaque narrows the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle and causing angina. There are several different types of angina, including stable angina, unstable angina, and variant angina. Stable angina is the most common type and occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen due to reduced blood flow. Unstable angina is a more serious condition that can occur suddenly and may be a sign of an impending heart attack. Variant angina is a rare type of angina that occurs at rest and is often triggered by physical activity. Treatment for angina typically involves lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases, surgery or other procedures to improve blood flow to the heart. <END_A>
