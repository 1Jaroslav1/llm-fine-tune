      "text/plain": "'Yellow fever is a viral haemorrhagic disease (bleeding from body organs) transmitted primarily by mosquitoes.\\nIt is called ‘yellow fever’ because in serious cases, the skin turns yellow in colour. This is known as ‘jaundice’.\\nYellow fever can be prevented through immunisation (9 months and over), before travelling to high risk areas.Yellow fever does not occur in Australia but is considered to be endemic in 30 African and 13 Central and South American countries.Current estimates indicate yellow fever kills 30,000 people every year.What are the signs and symptoms?\\n            \\n\\n\\nYellow fever usually takes 3 to 6 days to appear.\\nIt begins as a mild illness, characterised by:\\n\\nfever\\nmuscle pain\\nnausea\\nvomiting\\nheadache\\nweakness.\\n\\nAround 15 to 25 per cent of those with yellow fever infection progress to a second ‘toxic’ stage, of which half die within 10 to 14 days after onset of illness.\\nVisible bleeding, jaundice, kidney and liver failure can occur during the second stage.What are the signs and symptoms?Yellow fever usually takes 3 to 6 days to appear.\\nIt begins as a mild illness, characterised by:\\n\\nfever\\nmuscle pain\\nnausea\\nvomiting\\nheadache\\nweakness.\\n\\nAround 15 to 25 per cent of those with yellow fever infection progress to a second ‘toxic’ stage, of which half die within 10 to 14 days after onset of illness.\\nVisible bleeding, jaundice, kidney and liver failure can occur during the second stage.Yellow fever usually takes 3 to 6 days to appear.\\nIt begins as a mild illness, characterised by:\\n\\nfever\\nmuscle pain\\nnausea\\nvomiting\\nheadache\\nweakness.\\n\\nAround 15 to 25 per cent of those with yellow fever infection progress to a second ‘toxic’ stage, of which half die within 10 to 14 days after onset of illness.\\nVisible bleeding, jaundice, kidney and liver failure can occur during the second stage.Yellow fever usually takes 3 to 6 days to appear.It begins as a mild illness, characterised by:fever\\nmuscle pain\\nnausea\\nvomiting\\nheadache\\nweakness.Around 15 to 25 per cent of those with yellow fever infection progress to a second ‘toxic’ stage, of which half die within 10 to 14 days after onset of illness.Visible bleeding, jaundice, kidney and liver failure can occur during the second stage.How is it spread?\\n            \\n\\n\\nYellow fever is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes, principally, Aedes and Haemagogus mosquito species. \\nThe disease occurs in two forms – urban (household) and sylvatic (jungle) yellow fever. Both forms are caused by the same virus. In tropical rainforests, yellow fever occurs in monkeys that are infected by mosquitoes. The yellow fever virus is passed onto other mosquitoes that feed on infected monkeys. These infected mosquitoes bite humans that enter the forest, resulting in some cases of yellow fever. This form of the disease is known as ‘sylvatic’ or ‘jungle’ yellow fever.How is it spread?Yellow fever is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes, principally, Aedes and Haemagogus mosquito species. \\nThe disease occurs in two forms – urban (household) and sylvatic (jungle) yellow fever.
