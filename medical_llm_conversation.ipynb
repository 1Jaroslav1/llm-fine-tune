      "[HumanMessage(content='How are strong emotions and feelings related to schizophrenia?'), AIMessage(content=\" Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. Strong emotions and feelings can be related to schizophrenia in several ways. Firstly, people with schizophrenia may experience intense emotional states, such as anxiety, depression, or irritability, which can be triggered by various factors like stress, social isolation, or trauma. These emotional changes can sometimes be difficult to manage and may lead to self-harming behaviors or suicidal thoughts. Secondly, schizophrenia can also affect an individual's ability to regulate their emotions, making it challenging for them to recognize and respond appropriately to emotional cues. This can lead to social withdrawal, difficulty forming relationships, and increased risk of social isolation. Finally, some people with schizophrenia may experience auditory hallucinations or delusions that are emotionally charged, causing significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. If you or someone you know is struggling with these types of emotional challenges, it's essential to seek professional help from a licensed mental health professional. They can provide appropriate treatment and support to help manage these symptoms and\"), HumanMessage(content='Who should people contact if they suspect they is ill?'), AIMessage(content=\" Great question!
